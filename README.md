# A library of finance related scripts and projects in python.

So far:

1. Script to calculate VaR (Value at Risk) for a portfolio by intaking the portfolio size, average return and return standard deviation, it then runs a stochastic sim on the result and outputs a histogram for the returns distribution.

2. An example of a trading strategy test workflow, for now as a python script but will utilize jupyter notebooks for future strats + demos. This strat simply utilizes MA10 as a fast signal and MA50 as a short signal for buying microsoft stock between 2015-2018 on a daily timeframe and computes the profitability of this strategy.
